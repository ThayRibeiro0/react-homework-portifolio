        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I am a Software Engineer passionate about creating scalable and high-performance web applications. 
        With a strong foundation in JavaScript (ES6+), TypeScript, React.js, and Node.js, I specialize in developing
        interactive front-end experiences and robust back-end solutions. I also have experience working with relational
        and non-relational databases, microservices, Docker, and CI/CD pipelines. My career journey has been diverse, 
        giving me a unique perspective and adaptability. I have worked as an au pair, a lawyer, a logistics coordinator,
        a facilities operator, a cleaner, a banking sector, a sales, an administration, and even a customer service. 
        These roles have strengthened my problem-solving skills, resilience, and ability to work in fast-paced environments,
        all of which I now apply in software development. Currently, I am honing my technical expertise through the UCI Bootcamp,
        where I work on projects involving RESTful APIs with Express.js and PostgreSQL, front-end applications using React and Vite,
        and best coding practices for building efficient, maintainable systems. I am now seeking opportunities where I can
        leverage my technical skills and diverse professional background to contribute to impactful projects in the tech industry.</p>
